It's just like what my father always said — When every person in Natlan takes up the responsibility they can shoulder, Natlan will stand strong forever. The job is now my duty, and I perform it regardless of my level of personal interest....And on top of that, I was the most skilled among those who studied the craft in the tribe. If I didn't become a Name Engraver, that would mean someone else would have to take it on in my stead. The other students constantly asked me questions and copied my homework. Had it become their job to forge Ancient Names, I'm sure they would constantly come bothering me with questions.

It wasn't that complicated to make, but adjusting the angle of the seat was tricky. In the end, Kachina took my suggestion to ditch the seat in favor of a manual control system that connects to the power core of the drill...Huh? Why does Kachina bounce around when she's operating the Turbo Twirly?That's how she wanted it. She said she prefers having direct sensory feedback while she's driving, so I removed part of the shock absorption system.I do wonder if I should make her some mouthguards next, though. The last thing I want is for her to bite her tongue while using the drill..",
