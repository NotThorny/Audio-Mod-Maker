I—Is that an acceptable thing to do?Paimon What's wrong? Haven't we been helping out everyone this whole time? We may be doing an even better job than those deities!{NICKNAME} You do have a point...{NICKNAME} But when I picture people placing flowers or fruits in front of a shrine for me... it doesn't feel right",

Then you could go anywhere you want pretty much without having to move a muscle! Traveling would be way less tiring.{NICKNAME} But you already fly everywhere. Does that even get tiring?Paimon Fly... Fly? Wait, that's it! If we could find a way to make the boats float in the air, then they wouldn't need rails anymore. Hehe, and we could call them airboats!Paimon C'mon, let's go apply for one of those, uh... oh yeah — patents! We can't let Paimon's genius go to waste. Quick, before someone else beats us to it!{NICKNAME} Patents don't work like that... You can't just have a name for your invention. You also need to provide details of the original technical solution that makes your airboats float.Paimon Technical, huh? Hmm... Okay, got it! We just need to attach a giant propeller on top of the boats!{NICKNAME} Okay... But how would you prevent the boat from spinning along with the propeller? And how would you control the direction of movement?Paimon Um... Uh... Ugh. Paimon never realized flying was so complicated! It's always been second nature to Paimon...{NICKNAME} Hmm... Well, there might be an easier solution if we ditch the direction and speed control requirements?Paimon Huh? Really!?{NICKNAME} Yeah. It involves starting at a high altitude and flying downwards at a rapidly-increasing velocity.Paimon Hey! That isn't flying, that's free-falling",
