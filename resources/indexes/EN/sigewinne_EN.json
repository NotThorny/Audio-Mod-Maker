Like, when someone comes out of the Pankration Ring and they're laughing with their mouth but the rest of their facial muscles are all contorted, it means that they're doing it to cover up the pain from taking a beating. If you ever meet someone doing that, you should subtly hint for them to come to me and get patched up. But remember, the subtlety is important. Otherwise, it takes away the meaning of their laughter, hehe",

And maybe some of them were just subconsciously wary of us because we looked different... Back then, it was really difficult to make human friends. So I really treasured that one little girl who knew I was a Melusine but was still willing to hold my little round hand..",
