This is to symbolize interrogating {M#his}{F#her} own heart at swordpoint Will I tread the path of treachery, is there doubt in my heart, or am I resolved to eradicate all evil?Though you're not a Marechaussee Hunter, I believe that you're committed, like I am, to fighting the good fight.Why a sword, and not a musket? Because guns can misfire. Also, there's something a little inelegant about interrogating your heart at gunpoint",
